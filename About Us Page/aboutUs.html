                The project can be broken up into three subsystems. However, it is also important to note that while
                there will be three project teams, the subsystems must be able to successfully and seamlessly integrate
                with each other to form the larger system. <br />The three teams and their design domains are as follow:

                  middle school students the importance of nutritional food, general hydroponics concepts, and the
                  engineering principles of hydroponics in a practical, fun, and hands-on manner!  It emphasizes

                Both Penn State and Belgium Campus partake in this incredible hydroponics project, where students are
                given the opportunity to collaborate with international partners for a quarterly period. <br />
                This offers the following benefits for students involved in this project:
              </p>
              <p class="interacting-with">
                Interacting with students from another university (and another culture) provides students with the
                opportunity to learn about different traditions and allows students to see and understand different
                perspectives and opinions, which improves creativity, critical thinking and problem-solving skills.<br />Working
                with students from another university and cultures encourages collaboration and teamwork, allowing for
                better informed decisions to be made.<br />Participating in the project offers students a hands-on
                learning opportunity outside of class. Additionally, various soft skills and hard skills will be learned
                in the process of discovering more on hydroponics systems.<br />Students have access to the opportunity
                of presenting a prototype of the system to primary school students. This will allow students to come up
                with new and interactive ways of explaining the system to encourage participation and spark an interest
                of hydroponics in these students.
